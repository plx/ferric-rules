# Snapshot fixtures

`legacy-raw.cbor` uses the pre-envelope `EngineSnapshotRef` layout at
`56b39e7` and the existing ciborium 0.2.2 encoder. It contains the result of:

```clips
(defglobal ?*count* = 3)
(assert (durable 42))
```

The fixture was generated through that unchanged raw payload representation
while implementing the envelope. It is an old-format regression fixture, not a
historical user database. The test checks that the payload contains the durable
fact, then verifies public restore rejects its missing version envelope. The
declared migration is application-data export through the producing version;
Ferric does not automatically migrate raw RETE internals.
